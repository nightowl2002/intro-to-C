Some difficult things I encountered during this workshop are making sure that invalid inputs from the user were handled correctly. Another hurdle was the format of the expected output not lining up correctly then realizing I could just use a placeholder instead of spacing them out like I originally had planned. What I learned from this workshop is how to properly handle user input and invalid inputs and prevent them from happening. I also improved the clarity of my coding so that it is easier to read, and easier to manage. I also gained a better understanding of the for loop since I used it to iterate over each student record that needs to be entered in both the readStudentInfo function and the printReport function. As I now have a better understanding of loops I feel more confident in using them in my future workshops and projects. I also have a basic understanding of how arrays and how I can get my function to accept arrays as arguments like stno[] and mark[].
