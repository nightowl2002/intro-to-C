A C-string is a string of characters where each character is stored in memory locations one after the other and then the string is terminated by the null character \0. There is one big difference between C string and character arrays and that is that C strings must be terminated by the null character while character arrays don't have to be. C string also use functions from the string.h library for example, strlen, strcmp. I have gotten better at many things during this workshop but the main ones are concepts such as structures, and input validation and I am feeling more confident in the use of them.
